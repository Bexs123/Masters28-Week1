For tomorrow... take a look at variables and mathematical operators.

variables:-

A variables is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, 
or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.


mathematical operators:-

Arithmeic operators are has following:
+ Additional
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Remainder (sometimes called modulo)
** Exponent raises a base number to the exponent power. |The base numner multiplied by itself, exponent times.
Example of an exponent 5 ** 2 it will return 25, which is the same as 5 * 5.


Operator precedence:-
The calculation is always evaluated from left to right, which means multiply and divide are always done first,
and then add and Subtract.


Increment and Decrement Operators:-

Increment just means that you are repeatedly adding to the value.
Example: count++;

Decrement just means that you are repeatedly Subtract from the value.
Example: count --;


Assignment Operators:-

Assignment Operators are operators that assign a value to a variable.
Example: a+b

= Addition assignment
-= Subtraction assignment
*= Multiplication assignment
/= Division assignment


Comparison operators:-

comparison operators are used to run true / false tests.

=== strict equality
!== Strict non- equality
<  less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
