What is Javascript?
The language of the Full Stack Developer & not just limited to websites.
It's also the most popular language in the world.

Dot Notation:-
console.log(i);
Object.property

Example
Car.startEngine();
dev.makeCoffee();
Object = car and dev
property = startEngine amd makeCoffee

Coding is all about methods and Data, which means they are intimately linked.

Data Types:-
Strings ... for representing text
Boolean ... for true and false
Numbers ... for representing numbers (decimals and integers)
Null ... for nothing
Symbol ... this data is used as the key for an object property when the property is intended to be private.
Undefined ...for when a data type isn't determined.

All data has properties ... additional data or information that is available.
For example 'length' This will tell us how long the string is.
All data also has methods ... methods allow us to manipulate the date type.
Example:-
Date Type = string
property = length
Methods = toLowerCase()
Methods = toUpperCase()
Methods = trim()

Math.floor() ... returns an integer less than or equal to the specified number
Math.ceil() ... will always round a number UP to the next largest integer
Math.round() ... returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer

Node allows us to run our Javascript code in our own Terminal, without this you will have to set up multiple files, 
use Google Chrome's console and link up your files.

Libraries:- 
In coding, libraries give us access to a bunch of features that thankfully we don't have to code ourselves.
