// QUESTIONS

// Q1. Can you name the different types of loops?

// I used https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp for the answer to the question

// for, for/in, for/of, while and do/while loops. I actually already knew about for and while loops through Python course.
// The others loops are new to me. 


// Q2. How do you access an item in an array?

// You can access an item by using the index position.
// Example:
// create an array
let cars = ['Ferrari', 'Lamborghini', 'McLarenF1', 'Mercedes-AMG GT']
console.log(cars[1])
// index [1] will equal Lamborghini when run in the terminal
