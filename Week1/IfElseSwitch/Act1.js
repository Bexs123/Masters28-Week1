// ACTIVITY 1

// Create a variable called age. Write an If statement that logs "Yes I can serve you"
// If the age is greater than 17 and else logs "You aren't old enough"


// Stretch:
// Take your if statement and add a variable called country.
// if age > 17 and country == "Uk"


let age = 18;

if (age >= 17) {

// let age = 18;
