// ACTIVITY 2 

// Create a variable for any pizza topping

// Create a switch statement, if the topping is one of your favourite ingredients, log to console "These are important ingredients for my pizza"
// If you don't mind having pepperoni for example log to the console "I don't mind having topping on my pizza.
// Finally, for any topping you don't like log topping shouldn't be on a pizza.
