Functions...break our code up into smaller, reusable chucks.

Parameters... these really make functions tick!

Parameters gives functions flexibility they provide the ability for functions to act based on data inputs.

We can also call on functions to do a job and return the result.

Functions might call on other functions and use that to achieve its goal.

Functions have so far been declared using => arrow function syntax... it's intended to make it less wordy!

There are other ways...
function declarations
function expressions

Recap...
Functions are written to perform a task
Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, then return the result.
We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the functions parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function and use it elsewhere.
