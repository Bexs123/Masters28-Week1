QUESTIONS

Q1. Why would you if/else?

You would use a If statement to specifiy the condition is truthy.
Truthy is not the same as True, because true is a boolean expression that evalutes to either true or false.


Q2. What benefit does a `Switch` have over if/else?

A switch statement works much faster than an if else because a switch only decides which case has to be executed.
Switch is more readable compare to if-else statements.
