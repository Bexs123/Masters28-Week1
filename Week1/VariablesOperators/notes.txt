Variables...

1. Allow us to store data inside them.
2. Access them via a name.
3. Place new data in them whenever we want.

JavaScript is a ... dynamically typed language.
We don't need to tell it the type of data we are storing in our Variables. It just knows!

How can we declare a variable

let ...is used for declaring a value that CAN be changed
const ... is used for declaring a value that CANNOT be changed. Const = Constant
Var ... is used for declaring a value that CAN be changed. However, it is considered a legacy command now.

Examples
let i = 10;

const i = 10;

var i = 10; (do not use var)

Strings ... for represting text
Numbers ... for represting numbers (decimals and integers)
Boolean ... for true and false
Null ... for nothing
Underfined ... for when a data type isn't determind

Arithmetic Operator ... for calculations (+, -, *, **, /, %, ++, --)
Assignment Operator ... for storing values ( =, *=, +=, /=, -=, ++, --)

let i = 10;
Assigning i to the number 10

let 1 = 10;
i = i + 2;
// i = 12
Arithmetic Operator

let i = 10;
i+= 2;
// i = 12
Assignment Operator

camelCase ... it is best practice & industry standard as it enhances code readability.
