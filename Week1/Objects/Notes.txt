Objects are containers that can store data and functions. We use Key-value pairs to store the data.

Values can be any data type. They can even be arrays or functions.

How do you access data in an object?
By using the object.proprty: - console.log(peron.name)
OR:-
you can also use bracket notation
console.log(person["name"])

with brackets you can use variables to select the keys of an object.

Objects are mutable which is a posh way of saying we can change them once we've made them.

Using functions with Objects.

Since ES6, a modern version of JavaScript its easier to declare functionsin object.

You don't need the colon, nor the arrow syntax to create functions.

this... means this current object

So accessing this.hasSpecialOffers 
...inside the object is the same as saying cafe.hasSpecialOffers outside of it
